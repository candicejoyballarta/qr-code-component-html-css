## My process

It has been a while since I have created a project with only HTML and CSS. I mainly took up this challenge to have a refresher. My first step was to study the figma file provided and familiarize myself with the sizes, colors and layout, then proceeded to outline the component with HTML. Lastly, I then added the styling for this component. A simple solution for a simple challenge.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
